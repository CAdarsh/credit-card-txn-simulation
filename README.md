## Welcome to the Pomelo Web Application!

Hello Team Pomelo!

I have developed a web application that performs the following functions:

1. Reads a JSON object containing transaction data.
2. Simulates transactions based on predefined rules, updating state variables such as "Available Credit" and "Payable Amount."
3. Categorizes transactions as either "Pending" or "Settled."
4. Provides detailed explanations of each transaction in the section below.
5. I hope you find this project engaging and useful!
